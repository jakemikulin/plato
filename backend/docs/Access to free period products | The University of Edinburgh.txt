This is part of a Scottish Government initiative to provide access to free period products for students in schools, colleges and universities.
The aim is to support equality, dignity and rights for those who menstruate and to ensure that lack of access to products does not impact on an individual’s ability to fully participate in education at all levels.
If you have any queries about the initiative, or any positive or negative feedback on how it works for you, we would like to hear from you.
