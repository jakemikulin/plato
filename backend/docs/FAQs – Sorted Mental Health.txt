Positive Mental Training (PosMT) brings together proven therapeutic techniques of relaxation, mindfulness, visualisation, positive priming and reappraisal, within a positive psychology framework.
Like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), PosMT can lift your mood and change unhelpful thoughts and behaviours, but does this at a non-cognitive level - upstream CBT (uCBT). PosMT works by integrating negative thoughts & memories into a positive resource, generating positive feelings.
The programmes guide deep muscular relaxation, calm breathing and mental quiet, thereby establishing calm, security and safety in mind and body. You are then able to safely review the past, find new interpretations, new positive memories and create new positive visions for the future.
We recommend that you listen to each track once a day for a week, a minimum of five times, but you can adapt the listening to match what you need, e.g. twice or more a day or to listen to different tracks in one day. You can go back to any track you have listened to before whenever you think it will be helpful. Most people have one or two tracks they find particularly effective. If you listen at the same time every day it makes it easier to be committed to listening.
Most tracks lasts for around 18 minutes.
As each audio begins with relaxation it is important to listen somewhere safe where it does not matter if you fall asleep. You may find that your mind drifts or you fall asleep whilst listening, this is ok, your unconscious mind is still listening.
DO NOT listen if you are operating machinery or driving.
Definitely not! Your unconscious mind will continue to listen even if you are asleep. Many people find that certain tracks help them sleep better. Shift workers have told us that it helped re-establish good sleep patterns. Remember too, that you can listen in the middle of the night, if you wake up. Just tell your mind to ignore the wake-up message if you want to continue sleeping after the track finishes.
People describe feeling relaxed and positive. You may remember everything that was said on the recording or you may have found that your mind drifted. It doesn’t matter, either way your mind will have been listening and absorbing the positive messages, this can leave you sleeping better, feeling more relaxed, less stressed and worried.
The great thing about having more positive emotions is that it can increase vitality, so you can feel you have more energy, more motivation and zest for life.

We cannot give you a guarantee, guarantees are good for machinery like TVs or cars but not for the complex workings of the human mind. Although many of our listeners find our programme highly effective, we cannot promise that everyone will find this to be the case, however the feedback we have received has been overwhelmingly positive.
A key study has shown that mental health improved significantly after 4 weeks and remained better at 6 months.
Positive Mental Training has also been used within the NHS since 2006 to help patients and healthcare staff (such as doctors and nurses) recover from stress, worry and low mood.
There’s plenty of other clinical evidence too that shows how PosMT aids recovery from anxiety, depression and burnout and how quality of life can be improved.
Much research has been carried out on the Feeling Good programmes through the Foundation for Positive Mental Health.
