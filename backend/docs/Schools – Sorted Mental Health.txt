Our Feeling Good for Schools programme is not available through our website at present.
If you are interested in this wellbeing and resilience programme aimed at pupils aged 11-14 that takes a non-stigmatising approach to positive mental health, please contact us hello@sortedmentalhealth.app
The programme covers a wide range of mental health skills that are taught via our Teens audio tracks, and through teacher led weekly lessons, developed by teachers, psychologists and doctors.
 The bundle includes:
“[the narrated powerpoints] made it [adapting to Covid] a million times easier, because then all that happened was, [the teacher] just had to stick it on [...] you sent through all the online materials. I mean the communication and what we’ve had back from you has been amazing [...] it’s been fantastic to allow us to finish the course. So yeah that’s been fantastic!”
