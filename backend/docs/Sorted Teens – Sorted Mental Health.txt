Our Teens audio tracks are now available for FREE in the Sorted: Mental Health app! We've adapted our NHS-accredited Feeling Good for Life module specifically for young people aged 10–15, helping them build mental strength.
Sorted Teens supports emotional regulation, self-esteem, resilience, and goal-focused motivation—empowering young people to develop a positive mindset.
Teens tracks are still available FREE in our stand alone app Feeling Good for Teens (not the in US).
These age-appropriate relaxing audios combine relaxation, positive psychology, and Olympic Sports coaching techniques to build core non-cognitive skills, such as increasing self-confidence, and self-esteem. There is a short video to develop calm breathing too. Regular listening to the audio tracks builds inner mental strength, in much the same way as exercise builds muscle, so listening develops skills for life.
The Feeling Good Teens app is an integral part of our Sorted for Schools programme. All the audio tracks in Teens are available completely FREE, either in the Feeling Good Teens app or in the Teens module in the Sorted: mental health app.  Just download and start feeling good today!
