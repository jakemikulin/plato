The University of Edinburgh takes suicide prevention seriously. Our Student Suicide Safer Strategy for 2024-29 sets out the University’s role in seeking to reduce the risk of suicide for all students in our community.
The delivery of a staff training programme in partnership with PAPYRUS on suicide prevention is a key element of our strategy.
Staff in our services including Student Counselling, Disability & Learning Support and Student Wellbeing are regularly trained in suicide awareness and crisis management.
We have provided suicide prevention training to an initial cohort of approximately 450 student-facing staff, including Student Advisers, Student Support Managers, Residence Life staff, Security Officers and academics in 2024.
More staff will be invited to complete training in 2025. This will include Academic Cohort Leads, Programme Directors and teaching staff. For booking information, please contact Melissa.Hameed@ed.ac.uk 
Our Suicide Safer Strategy Action plan also includes:
