If you are in physical danger or in need of immediate medical attention, call the emergency services on 999.
We are here to support survivors of gender based violence, which includes sexual assault, harassment, stalking and domestic abuse. If you’ve experienced gender based violence, learn about the different support channels and what happens if you tell the University.
