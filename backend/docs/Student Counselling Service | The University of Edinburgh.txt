We support the mental health of all students at the University, using short-term counselling and referral to other services. 
Our Student Counselling Service is a confidential service, offering a range of support options to help you work through mental health concerns, personal issues and difficult circumstances. All students (on campus and online) can use this free, confidential service. They offer counselling in-person, and by video (MS Teams), phone and email counselling.
