Good feelings make your mind function better, improving focus & concentration, making it extremely helpful for your daily life. Good feelings also help you bounce forward from setbacks and overcome challenges in your life. This is resilience, and with repetitive listening, resilience & wellbeing will grow.
12 track Positive Mental Training programme for inner strength, confidence, and recovery. An evidence-based programme used in the NHS for 15+ years, incorporating Olympic visualisation skills together with relaxation for peak mental fitness and effective recovery from stress, anxiety, and depression.
Sleep is essential for rest and for sorting out the challenges of the day. Mental Training uses the mind and the body to create a better relationship with sleep; rapidly switching off tension and boosting relaxation is the best preparation for sleep.
We age as we expect to! Society tells us that we will inevitably decline and become frail, demented and sick. This doesn't happen with those who have a positive attitude to ageing. Break out of the negative cycle and live a longer happier life.
Working through these tracks will help you realise your goal to be a non-smoker. You should set a date to stop and hold that picture in your mind; using positive visualisations of your new self will help give you the strength to quit for good.
Which is why we have tailored our Positive Mental Training programme to fit the needs of younger minds. These Teens tracks are available completely FREE in Sorted: mental health app, and also a stand-alone app: Feeling Good Teens.(not available in the USA).  With active use, the Teens programme can increase confidence, build resilience and coping skills, while aiding young people to deal with the ups and downs of life, and feel good about themselves.
