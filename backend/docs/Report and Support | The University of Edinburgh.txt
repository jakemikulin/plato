How to use Report + Support
You can report either anonymously or named so our specially trained staff can support you further and discuss your options. You can choose how you wish to be contacted. 
The site is not an emergency site and is not staffed over the weekend. 
Using Report + Support does not mean a student complaint or conduct is automatically instigated. However, if you choose to report with your name, we can discuss this option further with you.
If you have any feedback, please email reportandsupport@ed.ac.uk.
