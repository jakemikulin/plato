We believe that GPs and Primary Care clinicians can make a definite contribution to helping patients with mental health problems. Keeping place-based treatment can avoid problems with referral, such as stigma and new appointments.
Our approach is to give clinicians the knowledge and tools to educate their patients in the science of distress and recovery.  Patients want to be treated in primary care. GPs attending our workshops find their job more satisfying and understand how to better look after their own wellbeing.
Starting in family medicine (primary care), we soon branched out into Psychiatric care.  A number of psychiatrists and psychiatric care staff (nurses and OTs) have attended our training.
These staff recognise that the programme is transdiagnostic and helpful for patients with different psychiatric ‘diagnosis’; indeed the use of diagnosis in psychiatry is regarded by many as unhelpful (see European Guide).
The programme has been used for recovery from stroke, and studies by Cambridge University. Results were very positive, showing participants really appreciated the ability to take control of their anxiety, and illustrated the use of visualisation and the recall of positive memories to power recovery.
It is heart-warming and insightful to read the contributions from the participants. Rehabilitation is one of the most important fields of medicine: the ability to promote recovery.
The Anne Rowling Unit in Edinburgh ran an RCT into the use of the Sorted App for those with Multiple Sclerosis.  Results showed a significant improvement in quality of life. The paper is being assessed for publication.
