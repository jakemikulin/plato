The Foundation for Positive Mental Health (FPMH) are a charity dedicated to promoting skills training for positive mental health, to enhance everyday wellbeing, increase resilience to, and recovery from, mental health difficulties.
We can all learn how to do this by using simple exercises such as breath control and sports mind training techniques. Interested in the Science theory supporting this? See here.
FPMH run training workshops for professionals and provide resources, including the Positive Mental Training programme, for the general public to access directly, or through the NHS. 
FPMH also supports the delivery of our Feeling Good for Schools programme, embedding resilience, self-esteem, and motivation in school pupils through positive mental training.
