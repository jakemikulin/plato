Using Sorted to support your staff has benefits for everyone.
When we started in the NHS in 2002 we worked with staff (doctors and nurses) to support their patients’ use of the programme. We soon found that many of the staff were using it for their own benefit, finding it a great tool not just for feeling less anxious and sleeping better, but for increasing their concentration and focus, and increasing their engagement at work.
