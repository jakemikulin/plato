If you are concerned about the wellbeing of another student, friend or flatmate, learn who to contact at the University and find resources to help you.
If you are worried about another student, we recommend that you encourage them to seek support from the Student Counselling Service.
It is important that the person you are worried about also makes contact with Service themselves, but talking to them about their options could help motivate them to get in touch.
