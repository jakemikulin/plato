Technical information about this mobile application’s accessibility
Positive Rewards Ltd is committed to making its mobile application accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
Compliance status
This mobile application is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard, due to the non-compliances and exemptions listed below.
Non-accessible content
The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.
Non-compliance with the accessibility regulations
Our videos do not have captions, so people with hearing difficulties may not access all of the information. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.2.2 (captions).
We plan to add captions for all videos by September 2021. When we publish new content we’ll make sure our videos meets accessibility standards.
Our questionnaires do not adjust to large sized text so people using large text cannot complete the forms. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion 1.1.1 (non-adjustible content).
We are working towards finding ways to make the questionnaires adjustable by January 2022.
Disproportionate burden
Navigation and accessing information
Interactive tools and transactions
We’ve assessed the cost of fixing the issues with navigation and accessing information, and with interactive tools and transactions. We believe that doing so now would be a disproportionate burden within the meaning of the accessibility regulations. We will make another assessment likely to be in a year’s time.
Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations
What we’re doing to improve accessibility
Our accessibility roadmap planning includes adding captions to videos by the end of 2021 and to increase adjustability of questionnaires by mid 2022.
