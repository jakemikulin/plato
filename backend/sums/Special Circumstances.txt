Special Circumstances

It is possible that you would also miss deadlines for some of your classes’ assignments. If you are able to, you should contact your Student Adviser to inform them of your situation. You can find the contacts for your Student Support Teams at: https://www.ed.ac.uk/student-administration/extensions-special-circumstances/useful-contacts.  

Depending on the seriousness of your illness, you may need to apply for a Coursework Extension, Special Circumstances, or an Authorised Interruption of Studies (AIS) for the rest of the semester or academic year, especially if your absence is at the semester’s beginning or mid-semester.

If you are absent for a short period of time and you feel that you can do and submit any assessments you have for that time with a slight extend of the deadline, you can apply for a Coursework Extension
