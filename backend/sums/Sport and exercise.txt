Sport and exercise

Physical exercise is also great for mental wellbeing. The University's Sport and Exercise team have made a number of online classes and tutorials available to help.

Active Lives will be offering regular weekly walks from central campus and easter bush campus. Keep an eye on our Keep Active page for more info. 

The University Sports Union has more than 60 sports clubs you can join.

The student team at Edinburgh University Sports Union have created this video for students to support our students in the conversation about mental health. Opening up can help you feel connected, break the stigma, and encourage others to do the same. #LetsTalk

During revision and exams, the Sports Union offers one-off taster events to help manage stress.
