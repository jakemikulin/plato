Worried about someone?

If you are concerned about the wellbeing of another student, friend or flatmate, learn who to contact at the University and find resources to help you.
If you are worried about another student, we recommend that you encourage them to seek support from the Student Counselling Service.
It is important that the person you are worried about also makes contact with Service themselves, but talking to them about their options could help motivate them to get in touch.

If you are worried about a friend who is a student, you can make a referral to the Student Wellbeing Service through their referral form

For emergencies occurring while University offices are closed, you can contact University Security by calling 0131 650 2257.
A member of Security will assist you or redirect you to the appropriate services.

This service is not designed or intended in any way to replace the role of the emergency services or other relevant agencies such as GPs or other local NHS provision.
If you feel like your friend is a risk to themselves, or you are extremely concerned for their welfare, you should contact the emergency services on 999 who can provide an appropriate assessment and medical care for them.
Mental health services Breathing Space and Mind offer advice on how to help and cope when you are supporting someone with a mental health problem.
