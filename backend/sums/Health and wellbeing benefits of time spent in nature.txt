Health and wellbeing benefits of time spent in nature

Medical research has proven the health and wellbeing benefits of time spent in nature

Green Prescribing is a form of Social Prescribing that uses nature-based interventions and activities to improve people’s health and wellbeing. It involves connecting people with non-clinical sources of support in the community such as gardening, conservation, outdoor meditation, wellbeing walks and our cycling through green spaces.

There are various green prescriptions available across Edinburgh, below are just a few you can explore, including:
