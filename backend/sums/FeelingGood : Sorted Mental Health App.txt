What is the app about? Positive Mental Training (PosMT) brings together proven therapeutic techniques of relaxation, mindfulness, visualisation, positive priming and reappraisal, within a positive psychology framework.

PosMT works by integrating negative thoughts & memories into a positive resource, generating positive feelings.

The programmes guide deep muscular relaxation, calm breathing and mental quiet, thereby establishing calm, security and safety in mind and body. You are then able to safely review the past, find new interpretations, new positive memories and create new positive visions for the future.

We recommend that you listen to each track once a day for a week, a minimum of five times, but you can adapt the listening to match what you need, e.g. twice or more a day or to listen to different tracks in one day.

Remember too, that you can listen in the middle of the night, if you wake up.

People describe feeling relaxed and positive. You may remember everything that was said on the recording or you may have found that your mind drifted. It doesnâ€™t matter, either way your mind will have been listening and absorbing the positive messages, this can leave you sleeping better, feeling more relaxed, less stressed and worried.

Yes, this programme is given out to patients by many different professionals in the NHS, including nurses, doctors, GPs, psychiatrists, many of whom will also use the programme for themselves. We have had no reports of harm.
