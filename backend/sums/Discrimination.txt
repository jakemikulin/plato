Discrimination

The University believes that all staff and students should be able to enjoy working and studying at Edinburgh free from any form of bullying, harassment, or discrimination. We expect that all our students and staff will be treated with dignity and respect at all times.

Unlawful discrimination takes place when an individual or a group of people is treated less favourably than others based on a protected characteristic, including age, disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy, and maternity (including treating a woman less favourably because she is breastfeeding), race, religion or belief, sex, and sexual orientation.  

If you feel you have experienced a hate crime or hate incident, we recommend that you contact the police in the first instance. To report an incident to the police by phone, call 101. If it is an emergency, you should call 999.

We are here to support survivors of gender based violence, which includes sexual assault, harassment, stalking and domestic abuse. If you’ve experienced gender based violence, learn about the different support channels and what happens if you tell the University.
If you are in physical danger or in need of immediate medical attention, call the emergency services on 999. 

It’s always your choice, but you may decide to disclose details of gender based violence to the University and make a formal complaint when the allegation is against a student or University staff member. Staff at the University will always ensure that you have the support that you need.
If you make a complaint against a University student or staff member for sexual violence, including sexual assault or harassment, the University may decide to conduct an investigation into a breach of conduct.
